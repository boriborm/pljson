# Purpose

The goal of PL/JSON is to create a correct implementation of JSON to use in a
PL/SQL environment. The Oracle object syntax has been chosen to ensure a
straightforward and easy way to decode and encode JSON. PL/JSON is delivered AS
IS and we cannot make any guarantee or be held responsible to any unwanted
effects that may arise from using this software. However, we would like to
stress that we have tested, and used this software, and believe that
it is a safe product to use.

# Description

Parsing and emitting JSON is done in two packages, but you will rarely need to
access these directly. The essential objects are linked to the relevant
functions in the packages (in constructors and output methods). Basically
PL/JSON can be used in two ways: Either you manually build up an object
structure and emit JSON text with the `to_char` method or you parse JSON text
into a object structure and use the objects in PL/SQL. Obviously you could also
parse JSON text into objects, modify these and then emit JSON text. There are
only three objects you should know: `JSON`, `JSON_LIST` and `JSON_VALUE`. The
`JSON` object can hold an object described by the `{ }` syntax and is named
`JSON` rather than `JSON_OBJECT` to keep the name short and the fact that an
object with the name object sounds silly. The `JSON_LIST` object can hold an
array described with the `[ ]` syntax. The postfix "list" was chosen over
"array" for two reasons, one: to keep it short, two: there seems to be a naming
standard in Oracle types that the postfix "array" is being used to describe
types with the "table of" construction. The last type `JSON_VALUE` contains
the primitive simple types (strings, numbers, bools, null), but can also
contain an array or an object. The object model for PL/JSON is shown in figure

# Tweaks
You can tweak the behaviour of PL/JSON by setting various variables in the
packages. The following sections are a description of the possible
adjustments you can do.

## JSON_PRINTER
In the printer package you can edit the line break method to linux, windows or
mac style. You can also change the indentation to the tabular char, or change
the number of spaces.

## JSON_PARSER
The parser is extended to accept more than just pure JSON. The variable
"json_strict" is defaulted to false and can be set to true to force PL/JSON to
only accept proper JSON. The current implementation allows input to contain
comments with the `/* */` notation. Furthermore it extends the definition of a
string to allow single quotes and converts names into strings. The railroad
diagram below shows the grammar for names accepted by PL/JSON:

```
name     : (letter) ((letter| digits | us)*);
```

However, the values "true", "false" and "null" will not be handled as names.

Example of usage with the extended grammar:

```javascript
{
  abc : '123"'
}
```

Parsed and emitted:

```javascript
{
  "abc" : "123\""
}
```

## JSON_PARSER: Javascript functions
Even though javascript functions are not a part of JSON, you might want to emit
functions if your receiving client is a browser. This is how you do it:

```sql
declare
  obj json := json();
begin
  obj.put('test', json_value('function() {return 1;}', esc => false ));
  obj.print;
end;
```

The output is:
```javascript
{
  "test": /**/function() {return 1;}/**/
}
```

Which is not valid JSON but will work in javascript.
The surrounding `/**/` is a message to the parser to start and stop building a
unescaped `json_value` string:

```sql
declare
  obj json := json('{"test": /**/function() {return 1;}/**/}');
begin
  obj.print;
end;
----
{
  "test": /**/function() {return 1;}/**/
}
```

## JSON_EXT
The extension package is now mandatory. It contains the path implementation and
adds support for dates and binary lob's. Dates are not a part of the JSON
standard, so it's up to you to specify how you would like to handle dates. The
current implementation specifies a date to be a string that which follows the
format: yyyy-mm-dd hh24:mi:ss. If your needs differ from this, then you can
rewrite the functions in the package.

# JSON PATH

A JSON Path is a way to navigate in a JSON object. The implementation is quite
simple and does not support all the features that are available in Stefan
Goessner's JavaScript, Python and PHP implementation of JSON Path. Actually, all
that it does is to add the support for navigation in JSON, which are already
build in into those languages. When navigating with JSON Path in PL/JSON,
members of JSON objects are found with the dot operator while elements in lists
are found with square brackets. Accepted input in path navigation is formalized
with these railroad diagrams (ws is insignificant whitespace):

```
jsonpath : ((alphanum | 'space')*) (( '.' ((alphanum | 'space')+) | '[' ('ws') (string | integer) ('ws') ']' ('ws') )*);
string   : (dquote ((unia|esc)*) dquote) | (quote ((unib|esc)*) quote);
integer  : pdigits (() + digits);
```

From version 0.9.6 the implementation accepts an extended grammar where you use
a zero-indexed JSON Path. The following examples show how you can use JSON Path
to extract from a JSON object.

The JSON Object:

```javascript
{
  "xyz" : {
    "abc" : [1,2,3,[4,5,{"123":45}]]
  }
}
```

Extract the ''abc'' list:

```sql
json_ext.get_json_list(obj,
  'xyz.abc').print;
-----------
[1, 2, 3, [4 ,5 , {
  "123" : 45
}]]
```

Extract the ''123'' number:

```sql
json_ext.get_number(obj,
  'xyz.abc[4][3].123').print;
----------
45
```

As of version 0.8.4, square brackets can be used to extract JSON members like
you would do in JavaScript:

```sql
json_ext.get_number(obj,
  '["xyz"]["abc"][4][3]["123"]').print;
----------
45
```

You can also use JSON Path to modify an existing JSON Object:

```sql
json_ext.put(obj, 'xyz.abc',
  json('{"val":123}'));
----------
{
  "xyz" : {
    "abc" : {
      "val" : 123
    }
  }
}
```

Remove unwanted elements is also an option:

```sql
json_ext.remove(obj, 'xyz.abc');
----------
{
  "xyz" : {
  }
}
```

In the 0.9.1 release, both JSON and JSON_LIST are hooked to the JSON Path
implementation:

```sql
declare
  v_obj json := json('{a:true}');
  v_list json_list := json_list('[1,2,[3,4]]');
begin
  v_obj.path('a').print;
  v_list.path('[3][1]').print;
end;
----------
true
3
```

The example files 8 to 10 provides a more detailed explanation.

In the 0.9.2 release, it is also possible to use path to modify objects and
arrays:

```sql
declare
  v_obj json := json('{a:true}');
  v_list json_list := json_list('[1,2,[3,4]]');
begin
  v_obj.path_put('a[2]', json_list('[true, true]'));
  v_obj.print;
  v_list.path_put('[3][1]', 'test');
  v_list.print;
end;
----------
{
  "a" : [null, [true, true]]
}
[1, 2, ["test", 4]]
```

# Behavior & Error Handling
Input to the parser is expected to be in the charset of the database. The
objects that are generated contains unescaped values that will be escaped when
emitted through the printer. To ensure correct JSON output, even from non-UTF
databases, only ASCII chars are emitted. All the characters which are not part
of ASCII will be escaped.

The errors or exceptions that PL/JSON may throw, can be caught with the
following code:

```sql
declare
  scanner_exception exception;
  pragma exception_init(scanner_exception, -20100);
  parser_exception exception;
  pragma exception_init(parser_exception, -20101);
  jext_exception exception;
  pragma exception_init(jext_exception, -20110);
  ...
begin
  ... json code ...
exception
  when scanner_exception exception then ...
  when parser_exception exception then ...
  when jext_exception exception then ...
end;
```

# Known Limitations

* key-names are limited to 4000 characters.
* The number parsing assumes that oracles number type can contain the input
  (in most cases it can).

# Test Suite

Any proper product is tested for correctness. So should PL/JSON be, with a
test suite that can be executed without installing any additional software on
your database. You probably don't need the test suite, but if you modify the
implementation or add more features, tests will be needed. Also if you discover
a bug, you could report the bug by writing a relevant test case.

# Optional Packages

* *JSON_DYN* A package that enables you to generate JSON from sql. Nested queries
  are not supported. See example 16 for more information.
* *JSON_ML* A package that converts from XML to JSON using a XSLT stylesheet.
  See www.jsonml.org.
* *JSON_XML* A package that converts a JSON object to XML.
* *JSON_HELPER* Work on JSON with set operations.
* *JSON_UTIL_PKG* Written by Morten Braten (http://ora-00001.blogspot.com).
  Generate JSON from sql using a XSLT stylesheet.
* *JSON_AC* Autocomplete package. Some PL/SQL IDE's provide autocompletion when
  using a package but not when using an object type. This package is a wrapper
  around the methods on JSON, JSON_LIST and JSON_VALUE. Use it if you often
  forget the methods on those object types.
